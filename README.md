- 🛠️ I’m currently working on a [Greenhouse System](https://github.com/orgs/SEP4-Greenhouse/repositories), a cloud-hosted IoT system for greenhouse automation. This project combines sensor data, a cloud backend, machine learning model, and a web application to optimize greenhouse management.
- 🌱 I’m always picking up new coding tricks and messing around with different languages just for fun.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in 'Stack Overflow search'.
