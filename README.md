## Hi there 👋

My name is Tomas, and I'm a student focused on Object Oriented Programming!

- 🛠️ I’m currently working on a [Booking Application](https://github.com/tomaspsotkka/BookingApplication), a C# app with a Web API, Blazor frontend, and SQLite database.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how the development process works in a real company.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in 'Stack Overflow search'.
