## Hi there 👋

My name is Tomas, and I'm a student focused on Object Oriented Programming!

- 🛠️ I’m currently working on an [Angular Portfolio Website](https://github.com/tomaspsotkka/AngularPortfolioWebsite), a personal website built with Angular to showcase my projects and skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how the development process works in a real company.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in 'Stack Overflow search'.
